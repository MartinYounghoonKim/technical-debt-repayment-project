[![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official-plastic.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

This project contains the code samples from the "Kotlin in Action" book (https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action).
To build the project import it as Gradle project.

Each of the samples is a self-contained file, and most of them contain a "main"
function. To run a sample, simply open the file in the IDE, right-click the
"main" function and select the "Run" or "Debug" option from the context menu.

Some of the samples do not contain a "main" function, and are provided only as
a reference or demonstration of a concept. You can simply study them, or you
can incorporate them into your own examples or exercises.

The numbering of the sample files corresponds to the order in which they
appear in the book.
